Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

Besides the template taken from HTML5up.net, the entire website has been edited by me, added things like tables, new organization, etc etc.
In my opinion it's quite different from the template provided. Thanks for reading. -Damien Lindstrom
